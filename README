jcerti is a Java Binding for the CERTI HLA RTI.
jcerti is SISO DLC compliant.  


INSTALL/COMPILING INSTRUCTION
-----------------------------
As a prerequisite, the following software should be installed
 - ant
 - xml-commons-apis

jcerti comes with a build.xml ant file
(see http://ant.apache.org/manual/)

Thus building jcerti should be as simple as unpacking the source
and calling
"ant" 

with no argument.

If you want more help about possible ant target just type
"ant -p"


RUNNING TEST INSTRUCTION
-------------------------
Before running jcerti example yuo should have C++ CERTI installed
http://www.nongnu.org/certi/certi_doc/Install/html/index.html

(or if you are a CERTI C++ developer you can just define
 CERTI_HOST and CERTI_HOME env variables and update PATH in order to make rtia/rtig executable automatically reachable)

Shipped with jcerti there is currently a small UAV Send/Receive test.
If you want to try this you should:

1) in a first terminal run rtig
2) in a second terminal run "ant UAVSend-run"
3) in a second terminal run "ant UAVReceive-run"

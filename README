jcerti is a Java Binding for the CERTI HLA RTI.
jcerti is SISO DLC compliant.  


INSTALL/COMPILING INSTRUCTION
-----------------------------
As a prerequisite, the following software should be installed
 - Sun Java JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads)
 - Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
 - xml-commons (http://xml.apache.org/commons)

Linux users, please make sure the appropriate 'javac' alternative is used.

Enable the javac alternative from Sun JDK using:
update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" javac "/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_19/bin/javac" 1
update-alternatives --set javac /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_19/bin/javac


jcerti comes with a build.xml ant file
(see http://ant.apache.org/manual/)

Thus building jcerti should be as simple as unpacking the source
and calling
"ant" 

with no argument.

If you want more help about possible ant target just type
"ant -p"


RUNNING TEST INSTRUCTION
-------------------------
Before running jcerti example yuo should have C++ CERTI installed
http://www.nongnu.org/certi/certi_doc/Install/html/index.html

(or if you are a CERTI C++ developer you can just define
 CERTI_HOST and CERTI_HOME env variables and update PATH in order to make rtia/rtig executable automatically reachable)

Shipped with jcerti there is currently a small UAV Send/Receive test.
If you want to try this you should:

1) in a first terminal run rtig
2) in a second terminal run "ant UAVSend-run"
3) in a second terminal run "ant UAVReceive-run"
